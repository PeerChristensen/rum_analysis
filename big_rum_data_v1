review_1889,My personal favorite,"
So far, this is my absolute favorite rum.  You don't need ice to mellow it out, it has almost no burn, but still full of flavor.  I wouldn't dare put this in a cocktail or with coke, it would be a disgrace to do that.  It is extremely smooth.

review_16145,The one that got me sipping. ,"
Diplomatico RE was my first sipping rum. Couldn't have chosen a better one to start with. Being new to the rum review game, I won't try to use fancy lingo like flavor notes, legs or complexity. I will just say that it smells and tastes like sweet deliciousness with a subtle burn. Drinking it neat is the way to go. Ice and water takes away from that creamy goodness and mixing hides that great flavor. I have graduated to less sweet rums but this will always stay in heavy rotation at my house. At around $35 USD (01/2016), this is a must have.

review_9269,The best. Period.,"
I've tried hundreds of rums, and have I've 75 different types in my cellar at home. I have 4 cases of this. It's that fantastic. Rich and creamy, heavy caramel and toffee, without being overwhelmed with hard oak. This is the epitome of rum, the gold standard by which all others are judged. Superb!

review_2726,Forrest,"
Diplomatic RE is an excellent sipping rum. Sweet enough but not quite as much as Zaya . Buttery caramel flavor with the smoky burnt oak misting through. I can sip a good glass of rum for two hours. Add a twist of lime and try that with this rum. Let me know if after about 30 to 45 minutes you , you don't find the nose has evolved to a different rum. All in a good way. If it were not more expensive than Zaya, it would also be a 10 but I have to say 9.

review_15759,Aint no rum,"
As tasty as this is, rating is down as it's not a rum - it's a liqueur:

Nose: Big caramel, toffee, butterscotch (you get the idea). Vanilla and dark fruits, maybe some orange skin. Tiny prickle of spice from the oak. The combination is not complex but it is certainly very hedonistic.

Palate: Big caramel, toffee, butterscotch. Vanilla and dark fruits......oh wait. Nose, taste and repeat. Very viscous and mouth-coating, actually quite cloying. Yep, it's a liqueur. Delicious though.

Finish: Actually surprisingly long, didn't expect that. Lashings of vanilla and a bit of oaky bitterness but I get the impression that the finish is just there because my mouth is still coated with the sticky rum and I'm still getting ""palate"" and not an actual ""finish"".

review_25675,"It’s not Rum, it’s a Rum-based Liqueur.","
Wow, this is like sweet, rum-flavored pancake syrup. Based on the reviews here, I went out and bought a bottle ($40), and was hoping to discover a new favorite sipping rum. It never happened. From the first sip, I was like..""huh?""  My background is, I have dietary restrictions and don't drink soda or eat a lot of candy (sugar) or sugary drinks or food, even. So maybe my tolerance for sugar is low, who knows. But this stuff is cloyingly sweet, the aftertaste is similar to that of having eaten hard candy. You can taste this sickly sweet residue in your mouth for long afterwards. Don't get me wrong, it's not ""bad"" rum, it's sweet and slightly pleasant, but for a rum purist, it's horrible. I can't believe I just blew $40 on this bottle of rum-flavored syrup. It also has a strong scent of vanilla, no doubt added. Like I said, it's not rum, it's a liqueur. It has a nice burn down the throat, but the sticky sweetness is horrible for me, and it makes me want to brush my teeth. Sorry guys, I'm voting against the grain on this one.

Diplomático Reserva Exclusiva comes in a nice bottle and the rum is delivered in a nice tube (as in the picture).
The smell is very sweet with lots of caramel, cacao and vanilla.
In mouth this rum is very velvety with a small hint of spice at the end. The taste is full of vanilla, cacao and orange.
The finish is long, mild and sweet with a little bit of spice.
A sipper that also goes well as a blender. This one should be in every collection :)

review_4971,Phenominal Sipping Rum,"
This rum was unbelievably great for sipping. I was fearful that it would be a bit too sweet after reading a few reviews and giving it a smell, but it ended up being extremely well balanced and smooth all the way through. There are rich sweet caramel/molasses aromas followed quickly by oak and smoky notes. The taste is very similar to the smell with sweet caramel at first, hints of vanilla, and then small oak notes. It is very smooth all the way through with no harshness whatsoever. This is like a desert, but not too sweet. One of my new absolute favorites.

I'll give a mention to this fellow that nailed the rum review: 
https://rumtastic.wordpress.com/2016/01/15/diplomatico-reserva-exclusiva-review/

It's just too sweet for me. Rums by their nature will tend to have a sweeter note, but this is playing to a crowd that wants liquid candy in their mouth. 

I'm currently experimenting with drier and spicier rums to mix it with in order to try and bring some semblance of balance.

review_2758,THE Diplomatico,"
So it was (one of) the fist of my aged rums, and it's why I love them that much.
As I don't taste it from long time I'm normally objective on this ratting (and I'm more interested on some Bourbon now ;p ).
A nice smell of mixed vanillia and caramel and a bit spicy, who remember me the Rooibos (false tea). On the mouth the same flavor is present but more stonguer, giving a round and sweat rum, with a bit of astringent and a long sweet caramel/vanillia finish.

Realy a nice and good rum for everyone. A great first choice for start aged rum.

review_2392,A worthy top rated sipping rum,"
I love the long thin slow legs that appear above the golden brown swirl in the glass. As I bring the glass to my nose there is the reward of soft vanilla and a tinge of cocoa and molasses to tempt my taste buds. I find the sweetness a delightful accompaniment to the report of spices from my olfactory senses. The burn is gentle as the golden brown goodness rolls around the sides of my tongue and down the throat. A delightful sipping experience.

review_27440,"Great Sweet Rum, Perfect for Sipping","
A lot of people will complain about the sweetness of this rum, or say it's not a ""good rum"" because it was sweetened after distilling. I'm not one of those people. I don't think that pouring a snifter of spirits should represent an endurance event. I want to enjoy it - and I definitely enjoyed this one. On the nose, I got butter, brown sugar and a hint of pinapple. I tasted caramel, vanilla, walnut and nutmeg with a hint of orange. Very little astringent burn on the tongue, and warm going down. A very nice rum.

I purchased this based on many reviews I had read online a few years ago. Boy it did NOT disappoint! In fact, at the time, it was the smoothest, tastiest rum I had ever had! Beautiful bottle that is frosted green with what appears to be a currency for the label. It looks great sitting on my or any bar. The nose is pleasant with vanilla and honey. The color in the glass is a fantastic rich cognac color. In the mouth, mild spiciness, wood, nuts and vanilla. Clean finish. Definitely a sipping rum and should be in your stash without question.

My first foray into more premium rums and I was blown away. Beautifully sweet but not overpowering, smooth and perfect for sipping.  

On a recent holiday to Keffalonia  I spied a bottle behind the bar and asked for a glass (a Greek single is like a UK triple 👌) the owner was stunned I knew it and went on to tell me all the awards it's won and that UK guests don't know what it is...  I drank the whole bottle that week and started the next one reminding me how easy it is to drink. What's more,  at the price point it is exceptional value and easily matches or outstrips more expensive rums I've had.

review_44470,Candied liqueur for people who don't actually like alcohol,"
In the glass, the rum is dark mahogany brown, co doubt thanks to a heavy dose of caramel coloring.

The nose is pancakes, toffee, burnt sugar, wood polish, leather - quite pleasant in fact. 

The taste is major downer, however - a super sweet concoction, like drinking cola syrup, with faint wood influence and meek burn. Overpowering vanilla taste, cola, candy, brown sugar, tiramisu, maple syrup. It's like drinking liquid candy.

This is a liqueur, through and through, and I would not have a problem with it if only it was marketed transparently. The taste is not unpleasant, if you like candy, it just does not taste like rum at all.

What an eye opener. The sheer... goodness of this rum was immediate and forever changed my go-to spirit of choice. Caramel, vanilla, molasses...sweet and buttery smooth...
I still enjoy locating new and interesting rye blends, but my liquor cabinet is now stuffed mainly with rum as I try to locate THIS 10/10 rum's equal - an admittedly difficult task as it's tough to surpass the perfection of your first love.

review_23685,"V Good, but not for every day","
This is a flavor-bomb, very complex and almost chewy.  However, I wonder that few if any folks here mention the licorice.  This stuff tastes like it was aged in Bookers bourbon barrels.   I mean, it's rum through and through, and very good, but the usual rummy aromas and flavors are overwhelmed by a stalk-y vegetal presence - and black licorice.  Straight up, it's very good.   But a splash of water or an ice cube brings out the licorice to a level I couldn't enjoy (of course, I don't like Bookers all that well either).  In the first third of the bottle, I was ready to buy 3 or 4 more.  By the last third, I was kind of tired of it.  So, I'll put it in the back of the cabinet, and 'rediscover' it at some future date.

This is truly a fantastic Rum. You can taste a sweetness that damp the strength of the alcohol so it doesn't burn as much as many other brands. It's sweet, fruity and less smoky than most. It's definitely recommended on its own (I think even without any ice or so). It should be relatively cheap to find and so it's a good first step in the world of fine Rums without paying too much money for it. Recommended for those that like a sweet (but not artificial) taste in their drinks.

Incredibly sweet taste – buttery caramel, butterscotch and toffee. It's an easy and kinda sirupy sipper. A true people pleaser rum (some would say liqueur).

review_45986,my favourite rum,"
I find it somehow similar to El Dorado 12, sweet, tasty and full of flavor, exactly on my taste. Nice sipping rum.

review_45408,A very elegant subdued spiced rum,"
This was formerly my highest rated rum, which also happened to be one of the ultimate sugar bombs with about 10 teaspoons of added sugar, albeit well chosen for the flavors similar to how a great chef chooses spices for stellar dishes.

Since my only bottle that I took a risk on that exceeded my limit of $50 per bottle slowly rose to the ranks of a 10 rating, I had no choice except to compare the Columbian to this Venezuelan back to back. Sorry, but no contest, since Dictador XO Insolent wins hands down for having my only rating of 10. This DRE rum still ranks at the top of my very small pack of rums that I have rated as a 9, but only one rum of mine deserves a rating of 10 at his point.

Update: My first bottle is now long gone, but deemed to be one of only two sugar bombs worth replacing.  The other sugar bomb is El Dorado 12. My new bottle will remain unopened for quite some time. When finally opened, I will record that date in my spreadsheet to make sure that it gets consumed within two months. Sugar bombs never last beyond 3-4 months due to oxidation in the bottle.

review_44987,Affordable sweet rum,"
I quite like this rum (or is it a liqueur?) as a sweet, easy drinker.
Not too much at once, or it will tend to get sickly.
I suppose it is lucky that I do as it seems to be the only sipping rum offering in many of the standard bars round my way.
Sweet to the taste, perhaps a bit too sweet, but nice flavour and smooth enough.
Not much of a wow-factor for me, now I'm starting to get pickier.

Personally speaking, I'd rather save up for something like the Centenario 20 year for my personal stash, but very happy to quaff a couple of glasses if I'm out (& there is nothing better)

review_44645,Aged Amber,"
As rum classification goes, terminology seems open to interpretation. For me, this and other rums (Zaya GR-12, Centenario-25, El Dorado SR-15) fall into the category of Aged Amber Rums. Within that classification, Diplomático Reserva Exclusiva is #1 or #2. I lived in Guyana for 6-months and am partial to this type of rum. I find the nose to be vanilla with a hint of toffee and possibly nutmeg. It is smooth to taste and leaves a light spiced fruit and vanilla aftertaste. Best neat or with a few drops of water.
