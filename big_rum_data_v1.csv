review_1889,My personal favorite,"
So far, this is my absolute favorite rum.  You don't need ice to mellow it out, it has almost no burn, but still full of flavor.  I wouldn't dare put this in a cocktail or with coke, it would be a disgrace to do that.  It is extremely smooth.

review_16145,The one that got me sipping. ,"
Diplomatico RE was my first sipping rum. Couldn't have chosen a better one to start with. Being new to the rum review game, I won't try to use fancy lingo like flavor notes, legs or complexity. I will just say that it smells and tastes like sweet deliciousness with a subtle burn. Drinking it neat is the way to go. Ice and water takes away from that creamy goodness and mixing hides that great flavor. I have graduated to less sweet rums but this will always stay in heavy rotation at my house. At around $35 USD (01/2016), this is a must have.

review_9269,The best. Period.,"
I've tried hundreds of rums, and have I've 75 different types in my cellar at home. I have 4 cases of this. It's that fantastic. Rich and creamy, heavy caramel and toffee, without being overwhelmed with hard oak. This is the epitome of rum, the gold standard by which all others are judged. Superb!

review_2726,Forrest,"
Diplomatic RE is an excellent sipping rum. Sweet enough but not quite as much as Zaya . Buttery caramel flavor with the smoky burnt oak misting through. I can sip a good glass of rum for two hours. Add a twist of lime and try that with this rum. Let me know if after about 30 to 45 minutes you , you don't find the nose has evolved to a different rum. All in a good way. If it were not more expensive than Zaya, it would also be a 10 but I have to say 9.

review_15759,Aint no rum,"
As tasty as this is, rating is down as it's not a rum - it's a liqueur:

Nose: Big caramel, toffee, butterscotch (you get the idea). Vanilla and dark fruits, maybe some orange skin. Tiny prickle of spice from the oak. The combination is not complex but it is certainly very hedonistic.

Palate: Big caramel, toffee, butterscotch. Vanilla and dark fruits......oh wait. Nose, taste and repeat. Very viscous and mouth-coating, actually quite cloying. Yep, it's a liqueur. Delicious though.

Finish: Actually surprisingly long, didn't expect that. Lashings of vanilla and a bit of oaky bitterness but I get the impression that the finish is just there because my mouth is still coated with the sticky rum and I'm still getting ""palate"" and not an actual ""finish"".

review_25675,"It’s not Rum, it’s a Rum-based Liqueur.","
Wow, this is like sweet, rum-flavored pancake syrup. Based on the reviews here, I went out and bought a bottle ($40), and was hoping to discover a new favorite sipping rum. It never happened. From the first sip, I was like..""huh?""  My background is, I have dietary restrictions and don't drink soda or eat a lot of candy (sugar) or sugary drinks or food, even. So maybe my tolerance for sugar is low, who knows. But this stuff is cloyingly sweet, the aftertaste is similar to that of having eaten hard candy. You can taste this sickly sweet residue in your mouth for long afterwards. Don't get me wrong, it's not ""bad"" rum, it's sweet and slightly pleasant, but for a rum purist, it's horrible. I can't believe I just blew $40 on this bottle of rum-flavored syrup. It also has a strong scent of vanilla, no doubt added. Like I said, it's not rum, it's a liqueur. It has a nice burn down the throat, but the sticky sweetness is horrible for me, and it makes me want to brush my teeth. Sorry guys, I'm voting against the grain on this one.

Diplomático Reserva Exclusiva comes in a nice bottle and the rum is delivered in a nice tube (as in the picture).
The smell is very sweet with lots of caramel, cacao and vanilla.
In mouth this rum is very velvety with a small hint of spice at the end. The taste is full of vanilla, cacao and orange.
The finish is long, mild and sweet with a little bit of spice.
A sipper that also goes well as a blender. This one should be in every collection :)

review_4971,Phenominal Sipping Rum,"
This rum was unbelievably great for sipping. I was fearful that it would be a bit too sweet after reading a few reviews and giving it a smell, but it ended up being extremely well balanced and smooth all the way through. There are rich sweet caramel/molasses aromas followed quickly by oak and smoky notes. The taste is very similar to the smell with sweet caramel at first, hints of vanilla, and then small oak notes. It is very smooth all the way through with no harshness whatsoever. This is like a desert, but not too sweet. One of my new absolute favorites.

I'll give a mention to this fellow that nailed the rum review: 
https://rumtastic.wordpress.com/2016/01/15/diplomatico-reserva-exclusiva-review/

It's just too sweet for me. Rums by their nature will tend to have a sweeter note, but this is playing to a crowd that wants liquid candy in their mouth. 

I'm currently experimenting with drier and spicier rums to mix it with in order to try and bring some semblance of balance.

review_2758,THE Diplomatico,"
So it was (one of) the fist of my aged rums, and it's why I love them that much.
As I don't taste it from long time I'm normally objective on this ratting (and I'm more interested on some Bourbon now ;p ).
A nice smell of mixed vanillia and caramel and a bit spicy, who remember me the Rooibos (false tea). On the mouth the same flavor is present but more stonguer, giving a round and sweat rum, with a bit of astringent and a long sweet caramel/vanillia finish.

Realy a nice and good rum for everyone. A great first choice for start aged rum.

review_2392,A worthy top rated sipping rum,"
I love the long thin slow legs that appear above the golden brown swirl in the glass. As I bring the glass to my nose there is the reward of soft vanilla and a tinge of cocoa and molasses to tempt my taste buds. I find the sweetness a delightful accompaniment to the report of spices from my olfactory senses. The burn is gentle as the golden brown goodness rolls around the sides of my tongue and down the throat. A delightful sipping experience.

review_27440,"Great Sweet Rum, Perfect for Sipping","
A lot of people will complain about the sweetness of this rum, or say it's not a ""good rum"" because it was sweetened after distilling. I'm not one of those people. I don't think that pouring a snifter of spirits should represent an endurance event. I want to enjoy it - and I definitely enjoyed this one. On the nose, I got butter, brown sugar and a hint of pinapple. I tasted caramel, vanilla, walnut and nutmeg with a hint of orange. Very little astringent burn on the tongue, and warm going down. A very nice rum.

I purchased this based on many reviews I had read online a few years ago. Boy it did NOT disappoint! In fact, at the time, it was the smoothest, tastiest rum I had ever had! Beautiful bottle that is frosted green with what appears to be a currency for the label. It looks great sitting on my or any bar. The nose is pleasant with vanilla and honey. The color in the glass is a fantastic rich cognac color. In the mouth, mild spiciness, wood, nuts and vanilla. Clean finish. Definitely a sipping rum and should be in your stash without question.

My first foray into more premium rums and I was blown away. Beautifully sweet but not overpowering, smooth and perfect for sipping.  

On a recent holiday to Keffalonia  I spied a bottle behind the bar and asked for a glass (a Greek single is like a UK triple 👌) the owner was stunned I knew it and went on to tell me all the awards it's won and that UK guests don't know what it is...  I drank the whole bottle that week and started the next one reminding me how easy it is to drink. What's more,  at the price point it is exceptional value and easily matches or outstrips more expensive rums I've had.

review_44470,Candied liqueur for people who don't actually like alcohol,"
In the glass, the rum is dark mahogany brown, co doubt thanks to a heavy dose of caramel coloring.

The nose is pancakes, toffee, burnt sugar, wood polish, leather - quite pleasant in fact. 

The taste is major downer, however - a super sweet concoction, like drinking cola syrup, with faint wood influence and meek burn. Overpowering vanilla taste, cola, candy, brown sugar, tiramisu, maple syrup. It's like drinking liquid candy.

This is a liqueur, through and through, and I would not have a problem with it if only it was marketed transparently. The taste is not unpleasant, if you like candy, it just does not taste like rum at all.

What an eye opener. The sheer... goodness of this rum was immediate and forever changed my go-to spirit of choice. Caramel, vanilla, molasses...sweet and buttery smooth...
I still enjoy locating new and interesting rye blends, but my liquor cabinet is now stuffed mainly with rum as I try to locate THIS 10/10 rum's equal - an admittedly difficult task as it's tough to surpass the perfection of your first love.

review_23685,"V Good, but not for every day","
This is a flavor-bomb, very complex and almost chewy.  However, I wonder that few if any folks here mention the licorice.  This stuff tastes like it was aged in Bookers bourbon barrels.   I mean, it's rum through and through, and very good, but the usual rummy aromas and flavors are overwhelmed by a stalk-y vegetal presence - and black licorice.  Straight up, it's very good.   But a splash of water or an ice cube brings out the licorice to a level I couldn't enjoy (of course, I don't like Bookers all that well either).  In the first third of the bottle, I was ready to buy 3 or 4 more.  By the last third, I was kind of tired of it.  So, I'll put it in the back of the cabinet, and 'rediscover' it at some future date.

This is truly a fantastic Rum. You can taste a sweetness that damp the strength of the alcohol so it doesn't burn as much as many other brands. It's sweet, fruity and less smoky than most. It's definitely recommended on its own (I think even without any ice or so). It should be relatively cheap to find and so it's a good first step in the world of fine Rums without paying too much money for it. Recommended for those that like a sweet (but not artificial) taste in their drinks.

review_45408,A very elegant subdued spiced rum,"
This was formerly my highest rated rum, which also happened to be one of the ultimate sugar bombs with about 10 teaspoons of added sugar, albeit well chosen for the flavors similar to how a great chef chooses spices for stellar dishes.

Since my only bottle that I took a risk on that exceeded my limit of $50 per bottle slowly rose to the ranks of a 10 rating, I had no choice except to compare the Columbian to this Venezuelan back to back. Sorry, but no contest, since Dictador XO Insolent wins hands down for having my only rating of 10. This DRE rum still ranks at the top of my very small pack of rums that I have rated as a 9, but only one rum of mine deserves a rating of 10 at his point.

Update: My first bottle is now long gone, but deemed to be one of only two sugar bombs worth replacing.  The other sugar bomb is El Dorado 12. My new bottle will remain unopened for quite some time. When finally opened, I will record that date in my spreadsheet to make sure that it gets consumed within two months. Sugar bombs never last beyond 3-4 months due to oxidation in the bottle.

review_44987,Affordable sweet rum,"
I quite like this rum (or is it a liqueur?) as a sweet, easy drinker.
Not too much at once, or it will tend to get sickly.
I suppose it is lucky that I do as it seems to be the only sipping rum offering in many of the standard bars round my way.
Sweet to the taste, perhaps a bit too sweet, but nice flavour and smooth enough.
Not much of a wow-factor for me, now I'm starting to get pickier.

Personally speaking, I'd rather save up for something like the Centenario 20 year for my personal stash, but very happy to quaff a couple of glasses if I'm out (& there is nothing better)

review_44645,Aged Amber,"
As rum classification goes, terminology seems open to interpretation. For me, this and other rums (Zaya GR-12, Centenario-25, El Dorado SR-15) fall into the category of Aged Amber Rums. Within that classification, Diplomático Reserva Exclusiva is #1 or #2. I lived in Guyana for 6-months and am partial to this type of rum. I find the nose to be vanilla with a hint of toffee and possibly nutmeg. It is smooth to taste and leaves a light spiced fruit and vanilla aftertaste. Best neat or with a few drops of water.

review_43835,A misleading greatness,"
First things first: I have a sweet tooth.  This rum is too sweet.  It is also delicious and anyone who says otherwise is a snooty liar! Are we good? Cool. On to the review:

I was expecting this to be good, but I was not at all expecting what I got.  I am not disappointed however. I was ready for this rum to remind me of summer days one the beach, but instead, I'm getting what I can only describe as ""winter camping.""  The nose starts off with an assault of brown sugar and butterscotch, but after giving it time, it slowly opens up to reveal mint, smoke, evergreen needles and stone, and something that just strikes me as ""cold.""  Entry is the smoothest I've encountered, thanks surely to the massive, undeniable sugar content.  The palette offers rich vanilla, caramel, and campfire, along with faint undertones of spearmint and marshmallow.  On the finish you get chocolate wafer, charred wood, brown sugar and tree sap, all accompanied by a comforting warmth that spreads throughout your chest.
Whether you want a winter mood-setter, or a summer time-warp, this rum is an absolute treat year-round!!

review_43480,All time favorite ,"
The Diplomatico Exclusiva Reserva has a delicious and inviting bouquet. The aromas coming from the glass are rich and luxurious. There is a whiff of caramel with  accents of cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg and walnuts. Some oak noted from the barrel aging lies alongside the other scents and smells.
SWEET but naturally sweet..
There is a nice underlying nuttiness (walnuts and hazelnuts), some sweet caramel and some very delicious spices (vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and brown sugar). As the glass breathes, The richness of the rum builds and I taste even more brown sugar and cinnamon with butter.
This a remarkable rum at any price. I’ve been sampling and experimenting with different rum for the past six months and this is absolutely my favorite out of the 30+ that I’ve tried .

In general this rum is good and  smooth good sipper. For its sweetnes and price it got not enough full body taste. Since its sweet and well known rum it tend to be overrated - yes there are better rums for its price.
Aroma: Sweetness dominates , then kinda fruity
Taste: Nice and smooth in begginnig due to its sweetness, little fruity then nothing big.
Compared to:
Pampero anniverasario: Pampero is cheaper, in taste its more full but less sweet.
Plantation 20yo anni.: For little more money you got much more in taste and aroma, plantation is little less sweet aswell

I am surprised by the high average mark, but from the top:
Nice bottle, decent price.
Nose: sweet caramel and vanilla, lots of vanilla
Mouth: Dominated by vanilla, an amount that cannot come from a bourbon cask alone. Sweet figs somwhere in there. Very smooth.
Finish: gentle, almost no burn.

While I like a decent demerara rum like Zacapa and El Dorado this is way over the top for me. The vanilla kills the other aromas and feels artificial.

review_37199,Syrup,"
Wow. I knew it was going to be sweet, but I didn't realize just how sweet.

As others mention, there's VERY little bite, and only mild warmth on the finish hinting that this is actually a spirit. That's not a good sign. This stuff is basically spiked sugar syrup, and little else. The more complex flavors are almost totally masked by the sweetness.

After sitting in the glass for 15 minutes, the nose congealed into the focused smell of vanilla frosting. I don't think I could tell the two apart.

I couldn't finish my glass. Ice wouldn't help, and Coke has gobs of sugar already. I imagine this could make a killer Daiquiri... rum, lime, and no sugar. Still, I see this strictly as a mixer.

As even ""Flawed with a glimmer of hope"" seems generous, I have no reservation in awarding this my lowest rating to-date. And this is just a wild guess, but I think the imaginary un-sugared version would be still be only a 6. Too bad they have no incentive to change...

9/10 for the complex wonderful aroma, 6/10 for almost liqueur-like sweetness. Altogether, 7.5/10 would be fitting. If they dropped the amount of added sugar from 40g/l to 20g/l it would have been perfect, possibly better than Zacapa 23 Solera. As it is it's too sweet. I really enjoy it poured into a snifter glass, as if it was a good cognac, and just smell it for a while. 

One workaround for the sweetness is to mix it 50/50 with Mount Gay XO. The resulting rum is simply perfect.

The Nose, for me, was a little oaky and balsamic vinegar. 

The initial split second it hits your mouth you taste all this opportunity for greatness, it just never achieved it.

It also has this Zaya like tone, there's this greasy finish with hints of artificial flavoring.

The lack of ethanol burn on the nose and tongue have caused a problem for me.

All the other flavors are now muted and dull. I would like this more if it had an Appleton or El Dorado 12 bite.

On the other hand, if you are new to Rum, this makes a great intro into Sipping. 

Your gf or grandma could drink this.

After drinkinking more rum I found this unbearable.

Very liqueur like, sweet to the point of being distracting. Getting close to a ready-made old fashioned, almost needs water... The most well known offender of added sugar in rum, 40g/l(?).

Altogether its still a good rum, It does best as an unassuming evening sip.

However, I deduct a few points for the damage it, and other rums like it, have done to the the image of rum. Unlabeled additives prevent an otherwise top tier spirit from the recognition it deserves.

Nose : sugar, fudge, cheap rum, cough syrup.
Taste : sugar, fudge, cheap rum, cough syrup. Very un-natural (who wrote about oak,  vanilla or refined aromas? Where is it ??)
Finish : what ? Ah yes, some cheap candy aftertaste. And the need to drink a large glass of water after all that cloying , palate-drying sugar.

Worst than I thought. Very disappointed. It is not even a good flavoured rum liqueur.

This beverage dos not taste like an aged rum by any way. Everyone has the right to drink and enjoy it , I have no problem with that but please, please, stop to call it a rum !!!

Nez : sucre, caramel, alcool type rhum de base pour les gâteaux, sirop pour la toux (plus précisément : broncorhinol, pour les français!)
En bouche : pareil. Ecoeurant et artificiel. Qui a parlé de boisé ou de vanille, ils sont passés où ???
Final : arrière goût bizarre comme après un bonbon. Envie immédiate de boire un grand verre d'eau après tout ce sucre écœurant.

C'est bien pire que ce qu'on m'avait décrit. Une mauvaise blague, à peine un rhum arrangé, on pourrait peut être appeler ça ""liqueur à base de rhum"" ?

review_19204,Best of Venezuela...so far,"
I've really enjoyed - and reviewed here - the lesser Diplomatico rums (Reserva and Anejo). For some reason I've waited a long time to step up to the Exclusiva, but now that I'm here I'm not disappointed.  At this level, the heavy pot-still component (a full 80%) dominates, especially given its long aging, and lovers of such rums should be ecstatic.  However, the column-still component brings this rum back to Earth, keeping it, I think, out of ""Robert Parker"" territory (meaning too much stress on the viscous, chewy, woody overtones at the expense of subtlety).  There's plenty of sweetness (perhaps too much for the whiskey drinkers out there) but delicious flavor complexity added by the oak, and a wonderful heady aroma, to boot.  And the color - divine!

I'd strongly encourage anyone to try a vertical tasting of these core Diplomatico products. That's a great way to understand the taste implications of Diplomatico's precise blending and aging strategy. Like its siblings, the Exclusiva is a top-flight sipping rum, and a tremendous value to boot. Highly recommended.

This beauty is actually the bottle that introduced me to the rum world some four years ago, and I lost my rum virginity to it. I never regretted since the first sip. An excellent choice for a beginneer, tasty, sweet and colourful. I've found some since, that I personally prefer more, but Diplomático Reserva Exclusiva is still fairly close to perfection, and my cabinet wouldn't be complete without it.

Very sweet and yet has a lot going with complexity. Sweet up front to the point you think that's all you're getting, but surprisingly you don't get to know it until about 5-10 seconds later. However, I feel it is not that outmatched by the cheaper Zaya.

This is the first sipping rum I ever tasted. I enjoy it neat in a cognac glass or in single malt glass. I love the dark colour and the sweet caramel aroma.

I really liked it from the beginning, but didn't think it was that sweet until I tried the El Dorado 15, which is definitely more of an acquired taste. I guess that's why they call it

All in all an excellent ""beginner"" rum that I will definitely buy again as I'm already out of it!

review_15235,Best yet,"
Can I give this a 10+? Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva is, simply put, just plain amazing. Rich and while very sweet (caramel and brown-sugar, some butter), it's not without some oak character to give it a slightly smoky bite, too, so it's a well-rounded rum - you can't go wrong with this. Straight-up or maybe on a little ice ( one cube only, maximum! ) but just way too good to waste on mix. Simply a must-have for any rum aficionado.

Rich golden thick rum. Quite fragrant for a rum (sweet). Smooth, low burn and not too much of a kick. I find it has a heavy molasses-y flavour rather lighter caramel.   Maybe a very slight metallic/copper taste if I had to say anything bad about it.

This is my go-to if I'm to recommend a sipping rum to a friend who typically doesn't like to sip due to its inoffensive qualities.

The best part about this rum is the price compared to the quality. Well worth it.

review_52312,Absolutely my most favorite rum,"
I was used to drink the likes of Barbancourt, Zacapa, and Flor de Caña. Then I got hooked un Methusalem. Well, that was until I tried Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva. It has a very good taste, not too sharp not too sweet. Goes well straight up or with a bit of ice, depending on your mood. Anyone who asks you to use this in mixed drinks should be banished or life. That's not what this rum is for. Also goes well with a good cigar. Those who have criticized this rum are probably accustomed to other types of rum, but in my book, this is as good as it gets.

This rum tastes exquisite. I didn't even try it on the rocks. It's warming, oily, rich in flavour. It gets really smooth after letting breathe for 15-20 minutes.

If you are new to rum. I would say this is the best bottle of rum you can start to sip neat. The flavours are smooth caramel, toffee, candied fruit and a lovely cinnamon and nutmeg mix with a hint of vanilla. This is a very smooth and top tier rum. Little to no burn. Quite deadly if you like your rum in larger quantities. I would never dare to mix this or chase it. Only neat or on the rocks for this one 9.4/10

Tried this at the Mai Kai last night, upon the recommendation of Kern Mattei, the manager, he said it was on the sweeter side which I enjoy. The nose was strong and spicy which belied the super smooth taste with hints of molasses and fruit. I will buy this eventually but settled on El Dorado 12 year for use in tiki recipes calling for a Demerara.

The color is a beautiful dark copper. The bouquet resembles some domestic brandies: rich, vanilla-y. On sipping neat it slides down with some peppery finish after teasing the palate with some dry, short-lived hints of vanilla and spices. Smooth but to me lacking in personality and when it comes to character not up to some competition in this price range.

I bought this rum to see what the fuss is all about (mention this one to rum lovers and you will start a war), some like it some hate it some say it is their holy grail.

Well to be honest at my first sip trying it neat I thought ""well this is what I imagined how a rum that pirates drink in the movies tastes."" It is sweet with the aromas of brown sugar, caramel, citrus and vanilla. I actually liked it very much. But there is some heat and it is too sweet to sip a lot of nit drinks in a row.

If you put ice in it it just turns to sugary water and mixed with other drinks is ok.

It is worth a try for sure but not an all night sipping rum for me.

Diplomático Reserva Exclusiva zraje dlouhých 12 let v sudech z bílého kanadského dubu a následně je destilován metodou ""Pot Still"". Magickou jantarovou barvu a výjimečně vyváženou chuť získává díky umu a řemeslné dovednosti místního sklepmistra. Vůně je velmi bohatá, příjemná a uklidňující. Je sladký, s ovocnou chutí, což je charakteristické pro všechny rumy Diplomatico, avšak obsahuje ještě vyšší koncentraci a intenzivnější chuť. Jedná se o výjimečný rum určený k pomalému upíjení, který se stal lahůdkou pro všechny milovníky rumů. Opravdový skvost.

Hugely disappointed with this. So much hype! It was so sweet i couldn't drink more than one glass. This product has some 44g per litre of added sugar - equivalent to 10 teaspoons of added sugar! That's practically a liqueur. Apparently, it also has lots of vanilla and other additives. ""Aged... for on average 12 years""?? You are joking - it's a blend of rums aged up to 12 years. How much of it is 12-year old? You should be able to tell from the taste. But the taste is masked by all the additives. A rum like Santa Teresa 1796, for example, has no added sugar. 
Good for alco-pop lovers or on your pancakes.....

On the nose you get a big waft of sticky sweetness, vanilla, fruit, rich syrup. A bit of alcohol heat piggybacks its way in as well with the sweetness. The rum is bold and sweet all the way through from the tip of the tongue and on the cheeks. Little no heat very smooth but a tad syrupy. The finish leaves a rich taste in your mouth that holds all the way until your next drink or bite of food and it leaves your lips a bit sticky. A truly bold rum that manages to be sweet without becoming overbearing. One of the finest rums I have tried so far.

review_49988,Pre mňa najvyváženejší 12-ročný rum,"
Ďalšou trofejov do mojej zbierky rumov je tento veľmi známy kúsok. Zaujímavý rum za dobrú cenu, ktorý prekvapí svojou sviežou chuťou a krásnym dizajnom.

Fľaša: veľmi krásna fľaša vyrobená z mliečneho skla, ktoré má svoju jednu základnú výhodu - neviete koľko vám z runu ubudlo...ale to je moj subjektívny názor. Fľaša je zaujímavo tvarovaná do typicky pirátskeho štýlu ""zapečatená"" tradičnou korkovou zátkou. Nie je tu čo vytknúť.

Vôňa: každá voňa je tu pekne uložená a primerane prezentovaná, najviac mi tu preniká vôňa vanilky, pod ktorou sa potláča vôňa citrusových plodov, bielej čokolády, medu a trocha dreva. Krásne vybalancované.

Chuť: chiť je sladká tak akurát, prevládaju tu chute medu, sviežych citrusov a bielej čokolády. Zakončenie je stredne dlhé avšak príjemne sa stráca sladká chuť a nie je cítiť alkohol.

Záver: tento kúsok ke proste jednotka medzi 12-ročnými rumami. Poteší každého milovníku rumov...aj keď osobne skôr preferujem suchšie rumy, tento je pre mňa príjemné prekvapenie a večerné posedenie na letný večer. Odporúčam každému, kto chce ochutnať kvalitu

One of my first rums and will always be stocked for now on. Complex flavor yet not overwhelming or strong. Perfect for an occasional drink on a warm day or a rum tasting with friends. For the price ($31 where I live) It's hard to find a rum to beat it.

It is a really nice and sweet experience taste this rum plain on baloom. Very aromatic and good bodies and mustered on mouth. If you want a nice and kind rum, this is a good choice.

review_49370,Too sugary for me,"
Nauseously sweet! Apparently, there are 40 grams of added sugar per liter in this, um, rum? liqueur? - and lots of other cloying additives like added vanilla. Also, the description above is wrong. This is not a 12-yr old rum, nor is it ""aged...for on average 12 years"". It is made from a blend of rums aged up to 12 years. Big difference.

review_49348,"Quite sweet, but very nice sipping rum","
Interesting and mellow straight out if the bottle. It only gets softer as it airs. Very warm, molasses/vanilla scent and flavor. Sweeter than most rums, but generally very enjoyable. Possibly the best sipping rum available at this price point.

review_49263,Una raffinatezza del Venezuela,"
Il Diplomático Reserva Exclusiva, invecchiato 12 anni, è un rum molto pregiato, dal gusto dolce, caramellato, ma delicato e piacevole.
Una perla del Venezuela che non ha bisogno di tante presentazioni, tanti sono i premi che questo blasonato rum ha vinto negli anni.

A super easy rum to drink neat or on the rocks. One of the few rums that women will drink straight just for the flavour. You can taste the vanilla and caramel

review_49165,Highly enjoyable rum,"
Seeing all the high reviews on the site i decided to give it a go, and what a decision that was! To start off this rum is sweet and has a nice burn to it. While others might not like the sweetness I think it's perfect the way it is. Currently this is my favorite rum and can easily be enjoyed sipped or mixed. Highly recommend.

review_49134,Better then some rums for 100 euros ,"
14.04.2018

Хорош. Запах очень приятный, совершенно не жжот. Вкус очень мягкий и сбалансированный. Именно сбалансированный...
Нету не приятного послевкусия. Но и не могу сказать, что после вкусие очень выражено... скорее ощущения, что ты выпил, оценил, и скорее снова наполнять бокал...
Сладость, но не приторно. Очень приятный Ром.
Вкус очень «глубокий», не поверхностный.
За эти деньги, а на сегодняшний день я могу его приобрести  в ранее 40 евро за бутылку, - это очень ценное приобретение.

review_48871,"Sweet, that's for sure!","
I think it's a solid 7. good (-ish) for value (depends where you buy it of course!), but I think it is not a real sipping rum. For this price there are far more superior rums with way more balance and complexity... But for mixing I would recommend!

review_48771,Great sipping rum,"
I was thoroughly impressed drinking this rum as a sipping rum. It did not have any fuel based flavor to it. The first taste I had was a cinnamon flavor which got me hooked having another double shot. I would buy a bottle and put it in my bar. Again straight no coke needed. Enjoy!
